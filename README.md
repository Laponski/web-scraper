# Web Scraping

This application works as a data scraper. In this case we aim at scraping all the images in a url. Not only the url we provide but also all the connected sub domains.




## 🖥️ Structure of Directory

- 📁 environment
- webscraper.py
- .gitignore
- data.json
- requirements.txt


## ⚠️ Important
There are some librarie srequired so to install them execute this:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## 🔋 Running the Application

To run the scraper simply execute this command and wait until a recap message is given. Then you will see all the data in the json file. The data.json mus be created by you as well as the environment

```terminal
  pyton .\webscraper.py
```
